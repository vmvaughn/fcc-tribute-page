      <h3>Here's a timeline of Thomas Edison's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1847</strong> - Born in Milan, Ohio</li>
        <li><strong>1854</strong> - Moved with his family to Port Huron, MI. With little formal education, he taught himself by reading, establishing a life-long belief in self-improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>1860</strong> - At thirteen he took a job as a newsboy and spent his free time reading scientific and technical books. During this period he took advantage of the opportunity to learn how to operate a telegraph.</li>
        <li><strong>1863</strong> - Struck out on his own as a young telegrapher.</li>
        <li><strong>1867</strong> - Fired from Western Union after spilling sulfuric acid on his bossâ€™s desk during an experiment he performed while working the night shift.</li>
        <li><strong>1868</strong> - Arrived in Boston where he began to change his profession from telegrapher to inventor.</li>
        <li><strong>1869</strong> - Received his first patent for an electric vote recorder, a commercial failure. He resolved then that he would only invent things the public would want.</li>
        <li><strong>1869</strong> - Move to New York City and developed his first successful invention, an improved stock ticker called the "Universal Stock Printer". For this and some related inventions Edison was paid $40,000.</li>
        <li><strong>1871</strong> - Setup his first small laboratory and manufacturing facility in Newark, New Jersey using the money he made from his stock printer.</li>
        <li><strong>1871-1876</strong> - Edison worked in Newark inventing and manufacturing devices that greatly improved the speed and efficiency of the telegraph.</li>
        <li><strong>1876</strong> - Sold his Newark manufacturing concerns and moved his family and staff to Menlo Park, New Jersey.</li>
        <li><strong>1876</strong> - At Menlo Park, Edison stablished a new facility containing all the equipment necessary to work on any invention. The first of its kind, it was the model for later, modern facilities such as Bell Laboratories. This is where Edison began to change the world.</li>
        <li><strong>1878</strong> - Demonstrated the tin foil phonograph for recording and reproducing sound to President Rutherford B. Hayes. This was the first great invention by Edison in Menlo Park.</li>
        <li><strong>1879</strong> - The first public demonstration of his incandescent lighting system when the Menlo Park laboratory complex was electrically lighted.</li>
        <li><strong>1882</strong> - The first commercial power station, located on Pearl Street in lower Manhattan, went into operation providing light and power to customers in a one square mile area; the electric age had begun.</li>
        <li><strong>1889</strong> - His various electric companies were brought together to form Edison General Electric. Despite his name in the company, he never had a controlling interest.</li>
        <li><strong>1892</strong> - When Edison General Electric merged with its leading competitor Thompson-Houston, Edison was dropped from the name, and the company became General Electric.</li>
        <li><strong>1887</strong> - Built a new laboratory complex in West Orange, New Jersey. From this lab he began again to improve the phonograph, giving birth to the recording industry. Improving the phonograph was a continual project for him until his death.</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong> - First demonstrated motion pictures, and began commercial production of "movies" two years later.</li>
        <li><strong>1899</strong> - Began work that paved the way for the modern alkaline battery.</li>
        <li><strong>1911</strong> - The lab in West Orange had grown to a vast industrial operation. Numerous factories had been built through the years around the original laboratory, and the staff of the entire complex had grown into the thousands.</li>
        <li><strong>1915</strong> - Accepted appointment to head the Naval Consulting Board, an attempt to organize the talents of the leading scientists and inventors in the United States for the benefit of the American armed forces. This became a precedent for future successful cooperation between scientists, inventors and the United States military.</li>
        <li><strong>1928</strong> - The United States Congress voted Edison a special Medal of Honor.</li>
        <li><strong>1929</strong> - The nation celebrated the golden jubilee of the incandescent light. The celebration culminated at a banquet honoring Edison given by Henry Ford at Greenfield Village.</li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - The great man died. His last experimental work, at the request of his good friends Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone, was to find an alternative source of rubber for use in automobile tires. After testing thousands of plants, he found a type of Goldenrod weed that could produce enough rubber to be feasible.</li>
